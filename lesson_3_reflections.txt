When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: if we are doing our work from various devices or as a group of people.
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: Sometimes we don't want to pull at each moments for small edits. I think so.
